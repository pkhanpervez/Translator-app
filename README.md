# Translator App

Welcome to the Translator App! This is an open-source Android application built using Kotlin, leveraging Google's ML Kit for real-time language translation. The app supports multiple languages and uses the flavor dimension feature in Android to manage language-specific configurations effectively.

## Features

- **Real-time Language Translation**: Translate text across supported languages using Google ML Kit.
- **Multi-language Support**: Includes translations for English, Urdu, Hindi, Marathi, and Arabic.
- **Dynamic Language Downloads**: Downloads and manages language models dynamically for offline usage.
- **Flavor Dimensions for Languages**: Uses Android flavors to manage configurations for each language (e.g., Urdu, Arabic, Hindi, Marathi).
- **Open Source**: Fully accessible source code for learning and contributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio**: Latest stable version.
- **Kotlin**: Configured in your Android Studio environment.
- **Gradle**: Latest version compatible with Android Studio.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translator-app.git
$ cd translator-app
```

### Project Structure

The app uses the **flavor dimension** feature in Android. Flavors are defined to handle different language-specific configurations:

- **`urdu`**: Flavor with the downloaded model for Urdu language translation.
- **`arabic`**: Flavor with the downloaded model for Arabic language translation.
- **`hindi`**: Flavor with the downloaded model for Hindi language translation.
- **`marathi`**: Flavor with the downloaded model for Marathi language translation.

### Configuring Flavors

To understand how flavors are set up, check the `build.gradle` file in the app module:

```kotlin
flavorDimensions += "version"

productFlavors {
        create("english_to_urdu") {
            dimension = "version"
            applicationId = "com.englishto.urdu.translator"
            versionCode = 1
            versionName = "1.0.1"
            buildConfigField("String", "FLAVOR", "\"english_to_urdu\"")
        }
        create("english_to_hindi") {
            dimension = "version"
            applicationId = "com.englishto.hindi.translator"
            versionCode = 1
            versionName = "1.0.1"
            buildConfigField("String", "FLAVOR", "\"english_to_hindi\"")
        }
```
